            <p>Chile stretches along a narrow strip of land between the Andes Mountains and the Pacific Ocean, Chile can be divided by its climate into three zones the desert provinces of the north, central Chile, and the humid regions of the south, and we are known for our earthquakes since we are located along a highly seismic and volcanic zone.</p>
